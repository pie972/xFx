## Description
We would like to take control of a shared folder under a remote system. More specifically, we would like to be able to:
1. Browse the remote shared folder, including its sub-folders
2. Rename a remote shared file or sub-folder
3. Download a remote shared file
4. Upload a local file to a specified path under the remote shared folder
5. Delete a shared remote file

Design and develop a suitable solution for this problem, using Java on the remote system side and Python on the local system.
